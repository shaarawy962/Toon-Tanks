A fun tank game made with Unreal Engine V4.25

## Description

Its just a game where you spawn as a tank in 3rd prespective view in the world and face some turrets shooting at you and you have to shoot back at them. The fun of it
is that the design of the tank and the turrets are not so detailed, that would make it unplayable on some low-end devices. I'm not giving up on playable games over astonishing graphics. Even the tank movement isn't that complicated and simply done to make it more fun to play.

## Blueprints or C++

Well for this part, I am using only c++ for scripting the game mode and also the configurations on the tank and the turret, I am only relying on blueprints for the visual aspect to check on the setup of the pawns.
